# quickdraw-cnn

A convolutional neural network using Tensorflow and Google's Quick, Draw! [dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) to recognize hand drawn images including a webapp to draw them.

Read my [blog post](https://larswaechter.dev/blog/recognizing-hand-drawn-doodles/) for more information. You can find a webapp demo [here](https://quickdraw-webapp.herokuapp.com/).
